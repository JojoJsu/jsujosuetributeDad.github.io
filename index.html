Chukwuma’s life is reflected in the composition of his many friends. Any attempt to name all of them could impact invidiously on the many who might be inadvertently omitted. Suffice to say his friends came from every part of Nigeria and other part of the world.

              <p>
                We launched freeCodeCamp with a simple list of 15 resources,
                including Harvard's CS50 and Stanford's Database Class.
              </p>

              <h4 class="list-subtitle">Son- Engr. Dr. Stephen Okwura</h4>
              <p>We added interactive algorithm challenges.</p>

              <p>
                We added our own HTML+CSS challenges (before we'd been relying on
                General Assembly's Dash course for these).
              </p>
            </li>

                We expanded the curriculum to 3 certifications, including Front
                End, Back End, and Data Visualization. They each had 10 required
                projects, but only the Front End section had its own challenges.
                For the other certs, we were still using external resources like
                Node School.

                We launched 6 new certifications to replace our old ones. This was
                the biggest curriculum improvement to date.
